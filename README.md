This Visual Studio project crashes after a few frames because of a C++ Access Violation which I just can't find, please help me!

To see for yourself:
* `git clone` this repository into a folder in your machine, or download the files with the green "Code" button.
* Open the .sln file.
* Make sure the compile settings are "Debug" and "x64" at the top of your screen in Visual Studio.
* Press F5 or click the green play arrow next to "Local Windows Debugger" and see the crash for yourself.
